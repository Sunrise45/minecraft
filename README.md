# ImageFrame Guide - How to use ImageFrame for custom maps/custom pictures
ImageFrame allows you to create custom maps from online images!

1. Find an online image. If you make a custom image, upload it to Google Drive, GitHub, etc. and set visibility to public
2. Decide the dimensions (e.g. 2 by 2) and get that many empty maps
3. Do ```/imageframe create [name, can be anything] [online url] [width in item frames] [height in item frames] [optional: combined]``` Example: ```/imageframe create grassblockbevo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sunrise45/minecraft/refs/heads/main/grassblockbevo.jpg 5 5 combined```

## More Commands
**Duplicate** an existing ImageFrame that you've created: ```/imageframe get [name of preexisting imageframe]```

**Delete** an ImageFrame: ```/imageframe delete [name of preexisting imageframe]``` Note:  leave the ImageFrame in its item frame. The map texture will turn into static, which will give all your empty maps back when broken. If you don't do this, you won't get empty maps back.

**Full list** of commands are under "Commands" [on the ImageFrame Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/plugin/imageframe) (Note: You don't have to download the mod since it's server-side.)
